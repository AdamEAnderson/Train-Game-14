Directions for map.csv files:

Row numbers in the excel spreadsheet do not correspond to milepost rows.
Milepost numbering starts from 0 for both rows and columns. Header rows in the spreadsheet don't affect milestone row ids.
Even numbered rows appear on the left side of the map, odd numbered rows are offset to the right.
